# PowerShell-Administrering-Active-Directory

These scripts simplifies administrating Active Directory on Windows Servers. I've focused on 2016 servers.

I'm working on converting the scripts to english for better understanding and to increase the number of people making advantage of the scripts.

If you have any questions please e-mail me:
-join('68656E72696A6F684070726F746F6E6D61696C2E636F6D' -split '(?<=\G.{2})',23|%{[char][int]"0x$_"})

(hint, run it in PowerShell)
